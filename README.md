# salesforce-dx-pipeline-sample

This application is a test app for the [salesforce-dx-buildpack](https://github.com/wadewegner/salesforce-dx-buildpack) and [salesforce-cli-buildpack](https://github.com/wadewegner/salesforce-cli-buildpack).

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Please note that deploying with the Heroku button above will fail because we haven't specified any resources. I leave it here because it provides a simple way to watch the execution of the buildpacks.
